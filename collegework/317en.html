<h2>CCTV exposes the dirtier side of ordering your dinner online</h2>

<p>
	A number of restaurants featured on online delivery service ele.me's website were not
only unlicensed and filthy but cheated customers with fake photos and information,China Central Television's “3.15” quality investigation program claimed last night.<br><br>

Online photographs of the Shisuda restaurant in Beijing showed a spotless stainless steel cooking stove. However, its kitchen turned out to be small and dark with oil stains everywhere, according to footage aired on the annual consumer rights program.<br><br>

A woman is seen biting open a ham and throwing it into fried rice which is then poured into a dirty lunch-box.

A stove at the Hongwei Restaurant, also in the capital, was seen to be on the street in front of the premises and, again, heavily oil-stained. One staff member was seen using dirty cleaning rags to clean a pot and a colander was placed on a bucket with dirty water and used directly without being washed.<br><br>



The program claimed the website didn't require its restaurants to have a license.
Ele.me said last night it was removing all problematic eateries from its website,and checking the licenses of restaurants nationwide.<br><br>

Last night, the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration said it had ordered Shanghai-based ele.me to submit a report on how it would rectify its operations and said it would punish the company if irregularities were confirmed after an investigation.

	<p>	许多餐馆在网上订餐服务的网站不仅无证和肮脏,还欺骗客户用假的照片和信息,中国中央电视台的“3.15”质量调查程序昨晚声称。在线Shisuda餐厅在北京的照片显示一个一尘不染的不锈钢厨灶。然而,它的厨房变成了小和暗到处都是油污,根据画面播出年度消费者权益项目。<br><br>

一个女人被咬开一个香肠扔到炒饭然后倒入一个肮脏的饭盒。炉子的宏伟餐厅,也在首都,街上看到是前面的前提，大量油污。看到一个工作人员正在用脏抹布用干净的锅和滤器放在一桶脏水和没有被直接使用。
<br><br>

网站程序声称不需要它的餐厅有一个许可证。饿了么昨晚从其网站上删除所有有问题的餐馆,和检查全国餐馆的营业执照。
昨晚,上海食品药品监督管理局表示,它已要求上海避署。我提交一份报告如何纠正其业务,并表示将惩罚该公司确认后如果违规行为进行调查。
